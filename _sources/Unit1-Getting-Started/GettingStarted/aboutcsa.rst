About the AP CS A Exam
======================
    
This course will prepare you for the Advanced Placement Computer Science A Exam. This exam tests your programming skills in Java. 

The AP CS A exam is 3 hours long and has two sections â€” multiple choice and free-response. You will be given one hour and 30 minutes for each part.  The first part has 40 multiple-choice questions, and the second part has 4 free response questions where you have to write Java code by hand. Each part is worth 50% of your grade.

Starting in 2020, the AP CS A exam will cover the following units and will provide formative assessments for each unit in the AP portal. 20 hours of lab time is required in AP CS A courses to allow students to practice Java programming. Note that abstract classes, interfaces, and binary/hex conversion have been removed from AP CS A starting in 2020. This course is arranged to follow the AP CS A units and provides many interactive exercises in each unit.
