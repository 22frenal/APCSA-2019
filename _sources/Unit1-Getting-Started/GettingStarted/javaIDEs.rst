The tool that we use to compile a Java source file into a Java class file is called a **compiler**.  Most programmers use an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) that has the compiler built in and helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs. 

You can learn Java by just using the interactive coding panels in this e-book. However, it's a good idea to also try a Java IDE to build code outside of this e-book. There are many Java IDEs available. Here are some of most popular ones used by AP CS A teachers:

repl.it
-------
If you are using a Chromebook or you cannot install software on your computer, you can use an online development environment like https://repl.it/ where you can login with a Google account or make an account. You can create new projects and all of your code will be kept online in your account.  One limitation of repl.it is that it cannot create Java code that uses a graphical user interface. It can only do input and output as text (which is fine for CS A code but not as much fun) This is a limitation of online development environments. 

Dr. Java
--------

DrJava (from http://DrJava.org) is a free, simple, easy to install and use development environment.  One nice feature is the **interactions pane** (the bottom area) which lets you try out Java code without having to create a class first.

BlueJ
-----

BlueJ https://www.bluej.org/ is a free Java IDE designed for beginners. It is built to explore objects and object-oriented programming and has a teachers' community as well as a playlist of videos online https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYPWr4ErjcnzWB95MVvlKArO6PIfv1fHd to go with the BlueJ Object-First Java book.


Eclipse
-------

Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer) is what many professional Java programmers use. It may be a little complex for beginners.
