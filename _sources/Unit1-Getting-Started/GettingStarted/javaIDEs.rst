The tool that we use to compile a Java source file into a Java class file is called a **compiler**.  Most programmers use an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE) that has the compiler built in and helps you write, compile, run, and debug programs. 

You can learn Java by just using the interactive coding panels in this e-book. However, it's a good idea to also try a Java IDE to build code outside of this e-book. There are many Java IDEs available. Here are some of most popular ones used by AP CS A teachers:

repl.it
-------
If you are using a Chromebook or you cannot install software on your computer, you can use an online development environment like https://repl.it/ where you can login with a Google account or make an account. You can create new projects and all of your code will be kept online in your account.  One limitation of online environments is that they usually cannot create Java code that uses a graphical user interface, and they only do input and output as text (which is fine for CS A code but not as much fun). However, repl.it has a new beta that does allow the use of the javax.swing graphical user interface library! 

Dr. Java
--------

DrJava (from http://DrJava.org) is a free, simple, easy to install and use development environment.  One nice feature is the interactions pane at the bottom which lets you try out Java code without having to create a class first. 


BlueJ
-----

BlueJ (https://www.bluej.org/) is a free Java IDE designed for beginners. It is built to explore objects and object-oriented programming and has a teachers' community as well as a playlist of videos online https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYPWr4ErjcnzWB95MVvlKArO6PIfv1fHd to go with the BlueJ Object-First Java book.

jGRASP
------

jGRASP (https://www.jgrasp.org/) is a free lightweight development environment, created specifically to provide automatic generation of software visualizations. jGRASP is implemented in Java, and runs on all platforms with a Java Virtual Machine (Java version 1.5 or higher). jGRASP produces Control Structure Diagrams (CSDs) for Java, C, C++, Objective-C, Python, Ada, and VHDL; Complexity Profile Graphs (CPGs) for Java and Ada; UML class diagrams for Java; and has dynamic object viewers and a viewer canvas that work in conjunction with an integrated debugger and workbench for Java.  The site includes both intro video and PDF tutorials.

IntelliJ
--------
IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) is a free Java IDE from JetBrains which many professionals use. It is a little easier to configure than Eclipse below. Here is a guide on how to set up IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/install-and-set-up-product.html.

Eclipse
-------

Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer) is what many professional Java programmers use. It may be a little complex for beginners. Here are some installation and configuration instructions for Eclipse for CS A Java: http://skylit.com/javamethods/faqs/Eclipse.pdf .
