Comments and Conditions
=======================

Summary
-------

-Comments are ignored by the compiler and are not executed when the program is run.

-Three types of comments in Java include ``/* */``, which generates a block of comments, ``//``, which generates a comment on one line, and ``/** */``, which are Javadoc comments and are used to create API documentation.


-A precondition is a condition that must betrue just prior to the execution of a section of program code in order for the method to behave as expected. There is no expectation that the method will check to ensure preconditions are satisfied.

-A postcondition is a condition that must always be true after the execution of a section of program code. Postconditions describe the outcome of the execution in terms of what is being returned or the state of an object.

-Programmers write method code to satisfy the postconditions when preconditions are met.
