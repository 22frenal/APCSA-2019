- Static methods can access or change the values of static variables.

- Static methods do not have a this reference and are unable to use the classâ€™s instance variables or call non-static methods.

- Static variables belong to the class, with all objects of a class sharing a single static variable.

- Static variables can be designated as either public or private and are designated with the static keyword before the variable type.

- Static variables are used with the class name and the dot operator, since they are associated with a class, not objects of a class.
