Two-dimensional (2D) Arrays
===========================

Arrays that we have consider up to now are one-dimensional arrays, a single row of elements. But in the real world, data is often represented in a two-dimensional table with rows and columns. Programming languages can also represent arrays this way with multiple dimensions. A two-dimensional (2D) array has rows and columns. A 2D array is an array of arrays.
