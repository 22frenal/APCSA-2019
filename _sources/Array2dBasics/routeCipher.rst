Free Response - Route Cipher
============================

..	index::
	single: routecipher
    single: free response

The following is a free response question from 2011.  It was question 4 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 4.**  In this question you will write two methods for a class `RouteCipher` that encrypts (puts into a coded form) a message by changing the order of the characters in the message. The route cipher fills a two-dimensional array with single-character substrings of the original message in row-major order, encrypting the message by retrieving the single-character substrings in column-major order.

For example, the word "Surprise" can be encrypted using a 2-row, 4-column array as follows.

An incomplete implementation of the RouteCipher class is shown below.

.. code-block:: java

   public class RouteCipher
   {
     /** A two-dimensional array of single-character strings, instantiated in the constructor */
     private String[][] letterBlock;

     /** The number of rows of letterBlock, set by the constructor */
     private int numRows;

     /** The number of columns of letterBlock, set by the constructor */
     private int numCols;

     /** Places a string into letterBlock in row-major order.
     *   @param str the string to be processed
     *   Postcondition:
     *     if str.length() < numRows * numCols, "A" in each unfilled cell
     *     if str.length() > numRows * numCols, trailing characters are ignored
     */
     private void fillBlock(String str)
     { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

     /** Extracts encrypted string from letterBlock in column-major order.
     *   Precondition: letterBlock has been filled
     *   @return the encrypted string from letterBlock
     */
     private String encryptBlock()
     { /* implementation not shown */ }

     /** Encrypts a message.
     *   @param message the string to be encrypted
     *   @return the encrypted message;
     *           if message is the empty string, returns the empty string
     */
     public String encryptMessage(String message)
     { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

     // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown
   }

Solve Part A
------------

(a) Write the method `fillBlock` that fills the two-dimensional array `letterBlock` with one-character strings from the string passed as parameter `str`.


The array must be filled in row-major orderâ€”the first row is filled from left to right, then the second row is filled from left to right, and so on, until all rows are filled.

If the length of the parameter `str` is smaller than the number of elements of the array, the string "A" is placed in each of the unfilled cells. If the length of `str` is larger than the number of elements in the array, the trailing characters are ignored.

For example, if `letterBlock` has 3 rows and 5 columns and `str` is the string "Meet at noon", the resulting contents of `letterBlock` would be as shown in the following table.

   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

If `letterBlock` has 3 rows and 5 columns and `str` is the string "Meet at midnight", the resulting contents of `letterBlock` would be as shown in the following table.

.. figure:: Figures/routeCipherTable2.png
   :width: 158px
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center


The following expression may be used to obtain a single-character string at position `k` of the string `str`.

.. code-block:: java
   str.substring(k, k + 1)

Complete the method `fillBlock` below.

.. activecode:: FRQRouteCipherA
   :language: java

   /** Places a string into letterBlock in row-major order.
   *   @param str the string to be processed
   *   Postcondition:
   *     if str.length() < numRows * numCols, "A" is placed in each unfilled cell
   *     if str.length() > numRows * numCols, trailing characters are ignored
   */
   private void fillBlock(String str)

Solve Part B
------------

(b) Write the method `encryptMessage` that encrypts its string parameter message. The method builds an encrypted version of message by repeatedly calling `fillBlock` with consecutive, nonoverlapping substrings of `message` and concatenating the results returned by a call to `encryptBlock` after each call to `fillBlock`. When all of `message` has been processed, the concatenated string is returned. Note that if `message` is the empty string, `encryptMessage` returns an empty string.

The following example shows the process carried out if letterBlock has 2 rows and 3 columns and encryptMessage("Meet at midnight") is executed.

.. figure:: Figures/routeCipherFig2.png
   :width: 482px
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

In this example, the method returns the string "Mte eati dmnitgAhA".

Assume that `fillBlock` and `encryptBlock` methods work as specified. Solutions that reimplement the functionality of one or both of these methods will not receive full credit.

Complete method `encryptMessage` below.

.. activecode:: FRQRouteCipherB
   :language: java

   /** Encrypts a message.
   *   @param message the string to be encrypted
   *   @return the encrypted message;
   *           if message is the empty string, returns the empty string
   */
   public String encryptMessage(String message)
