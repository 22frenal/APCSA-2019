Free Response - Sound
=====================

..	index::
	single: sound
    single: free response

The following is a free response question from 2011.  It was question 1 on the exam.  You can see all the free response questions from past exams at https://apstudent.collegeboard.org/apcourse/ap-computer-science-a/exam-practice.

**Question 1.**  Digital sounds can be represented as an array of integer values. For this question, you will write two unrelated methods of the *Sound* class.

A partial declaration of the *Sound* class is shown below.

.. code-block:: java

   public class Sound
   {
    /** the array of values in this sound; guaranteed not to be null */
    private int[] samples;

    /** Changes those values in this sound that have an amplitude greater than limit */
     *  Values greater than limit are changed to limit.
     *  @param limit the amplitude limit
     *         Precondition: limit >= 0
     *  @return the number of values in this sound that this method changed
     */
    public int limitAmplitude(int limit)
    { /* to be implemented in part (a) */ }

    /** Removes all silence from the beginning of this sound.
     *  Silence is represented by a value of 0.
     *  Precondition: samples contains at least one nonzero value
     *  Postcondition: the length of samples reflects the removal of starting silence
     */
    public void trimSilenceFromBeginning()
    { /* to be implemented in part (b) */ }

    // There may be instance variables, constructors, and methods that are not shown.
   }

Solve Part A
------------

(a) The volume of a sound depends on the amplitude of each value in the sound. The amplitude of a value is its absolute value. For example, the amplitude of -2300 is 2300 and the amplitude of 4000 is 4000.

Write the method *limitAmplitude* that will change any value that has an amplitude greater than the
given limit. Values that are greater than *limit* are replaced with *limit*, and values that are less than
*-limit* are replaced with *â€“limit*. The method returns the total number of values that were changed in
the array. For example, assume that the array samples has been initialized with the following values.

   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

When the statement

.. code-block:: java

   int numChanges = limitAmplitude(2000);

is executed, the value of *numChanges* will be 5, and the array *samples* will contain the following values.

.. figure:: Figures/soundTable2.png
   :width: 593px
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

Complete method *limitAmplitude* below.

.. activecode:: FRQSoundA
   :language: java

   /** Changes those values in this sound that have an amplitude greater than limit.
    *  Values greater than limit are changed to limit.
    *  Values less than -limit are changed to -limit.
    *  @param limit the amplitude limit
    *         Precondition: limit >= 0
    *  @return the number of values in this sound that this method changed
    */
   public int limitAmplitude(int limit)

Solve Part B
------------

(b) Recorded sound often begins with silence. Silence in a sound is represented by a value of 0.

Write the method *trimSilenceFromBeginning* that removes the silence from the beginning of a
sound. To remove starting silence, a new array of values is created that contains the same values as the
original *samples* array in the same order but without the leading zeros. The instance variable *samples*
is updated to refer to the new array. For example, suppose the instance variable *samples* refers to the
following array.

.. figure:: Figures/soundTable3.png
   :width: 617px
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

After *trimSilenceFromBeginning* has been called, the instance variable *samples* will refer to the following array.

.. figure:: Figures/soundTable4.png
   :width: 470px
   :align: center
   :figclass: align-center

Complete method *trimSilenceFromBeginning* below.

.. activecode:: FRQSoundB
   :language: java

   /** Removes all silence from the beginning of this sound.
    *  Silence is represented by a value of 0
    *  Precondition: samples contains at least one nonzero value
    *  Postcondition: the length of samples reflects the removal of starting silence
    */
   public void trimSilenceFromBeginning()
